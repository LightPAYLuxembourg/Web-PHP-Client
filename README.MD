# LightPAY Web API


This is a client API that allow you to interact with LightPAY Web API server in order to receive payment with the digital meal voucher through your web site  **without redirect your customer out of your shop**.
> API functions: 
> - receive payments
> - get payment information
> - refund totally or partially
> - payment cancellation (total refund)

### Before start
In order to get access to your back office you should have a merchant account.
Once you access your back office, you will get `Ceredentials` for both test and production modes.

Please contact us by email : [info@lightpay.lu](mailto:info@lightpay.lu) or visit our website [www.lightpay.lu](www.lightpay.lu)

### About this API
Since LightPAY is smartphone application, the payment will be executed directly in the customer device, the way to implement this API is a bit unique!
- You don't have to handle the payment errors, instead a notification with error description will pop-up at the customer's application.
- You don't need to store the payment token (except for statistic reasons or if you have special reason to do so)
- The payment is not executed in the merchant shop (e.g. visa card), instead it is done in the customer's application.
- You will be notified for all success payment via the `success_url` (see [Back office](#Back office)); and we will not bother you with errors messages :-)


### Payment procedure
Let's say the customer has placed an order at your shop, and clicked `Pay with LightPAY` button.

1. the merchant shop will create a page to initiate the payment `/v1/web/api/payments/init` [see sample here](public/index.php)
2. a payment token will be received within the response
3. then the merchant shop should:

    a) generate a QR-Code with the payment token : this will be used in case your customer placed the order using a PC, so he can scan the QR-Code within LightPAY application.
    
    b) create a button just below the QR-Code to allow customers to copy/paste the token into the application (in case using a smartphone).

> please see [sample project here](public/index.php), you have full example designed for PC and it is also mobile friendly
    
4. the payment is executed once your customer scan or copy/paste the token on LightPAY application.
5. our server will notify the customer about the payment status (success/error) and will send you the response only in case of success through the `success_url` which you defined in your [Back office](#Back office).

    


### Local testing
If you need to test the API on your locale machine, you can use a service such as `ngrok.com` to redirect the responses from our server to your local machine.
You also need to specify the forwarding url prompted by `ngrok` in your back office.

### Notation
The following table describe the different formats that you encounter when implementing your API.

| Notation | Description                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| A        | Alphabetic characters (from ‘A’ to ‘Z’ and from ‘a’ to ‘z’) |
| N        | Numeric characters |
| S        | Special characters ('-', '_', '.', '$') |
| AN       | Alphanumeric characters |
| ANS      | Alphanumeric and special characters, use this regex to test  : `/^([\p{L}0-9\-_\.,\&#\$\*=@\/%:;\?\+\s]+-?)+$/` |
| MAP      | List of key/value pairs ​​separated by a “;”. <br><br>Each key/value pair contains the name of the key followed by “=”, followed by a value.<br>The value can be a string only.<br>The list of possible values ​​​​for each key/value pair is provided in the field definition.<br><br>Example: foo=bar;bar=cool |



### Initiate a payment

> note that default `mode` is set to `test`, so please change it to `prod` (in the constructor) when you finish testing

### API
In this project we used a pre-configured PHP client which implement all what you need to make your payment process functional, and ready for you. 
But if you need to implement your own class using your own technology, so it is accepted by our server, you must follow the steps below (signature step is very important!).

> All data in the form must be UTF-8 encoded.

### Responses
All responses will be a `JSON` formatted object.

#### Payment response
The payment response will be sent by a server-server communication, you need to whitelist the IP address range `80.92.90.96/32`.
The only way to get the payment response is via the `success_url`.
Our server will notify the customer about the payment status (success/error) and will send you the response only in case of success through the `success_url` which you defined in your [Back office](#Back office).

 
> please note that responses will be sent as a `POST` request

#### Response body
The response parameters can change depend on the request, see the different examples below.

| Name           | Description                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| status         | status string represented `success` or `error`  |
| code           | status code `success`:`200` `error`:`300`                      |
| token          | payment token |
| payment_status | payment status [see Status chapter](#Payment status) |
| trx_id         | you should store this one! this is the only way to get information about the transaction  |
| trx_date       | datetime format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`                        |
| shop_id        | your shop ID                       |
| ref            | your order reference                         |
| msg            | text message about the payment status      |
| custom_fields  | if set in the init request, a key=value pair ";" separated, each key/value will be sent with `success_url` as individual `POST` PARAMETERS |


### Payment status
There are 7 types of status :

| Status                    | Description                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| REGISTERED                | the payment was successful and waiting for capturing  |
| CAPTURED                  | the payment has been captured by the bank   |
| AWAITING_TOTAL_REFUND     | waiting for total refund              |
| AWAITING_PARTIAL_REFUND   | waiting for partial refund               |
| TOTALLY_REFUNDED          | the payment has been totally refunded               |
| PARTIALLY_REFUNDED        | the payment has been partially refunded               |
| CANCELED                  | the payment has been canceled (total refund)                   |





### Building a Request
Each request must include the flowing parameters :

#### Important note
> all request parameters should be `sorted` regardless of the request method (post, get, delete, put...)
> in php use `ksort` function with `SORT_NATURAL` flag


#### Headers
All the flowing headers are mandatory and if they are not set, the server will not accept your request.

#### Time
set the timestamp in the `X-LightPAY-Timestamp` header.

```bash
X-LightPAY-Timestamp: time()
```

#### Sign parameters
> only `AES-128-CBC` algorithm should be used with `PKCS7` as padding mode (in PHP set to 0 because this is the default mode)

All request parameters must be concatenated with `+`, then signed. This process need to be done in a very precise order, please check the right order below:
> the result of this signature should be set in the `X-LightPAY-Signature` header

##### <u>Signing order:</u>
1. api_key
2. secret_key
3. consumer_key
4. method
5. url
6. body
7. now

- `key` should be the first 32 characters of the `secret_key`
- `iv` should be the first 32 characters of the `consumer_key`


```bash
// set the signature header
// here SIGN is a dummy function, use your own fuction or see the Signing chapter
X-LightPAY-Signature: SIGN(api_key+secret_key+consumer_key+method+url+body+now)
```

To test your hash, compare it to the PHP openssl_decrypt. 
Do a hash `hello wrold` with the language of your choice, and set you hash to `$yourHash` in the code below to test the result.
> please use the key and IV below for testing 
> If you do not have a PHP environment set, use an online tool such as [extendsclass.com](https://extendsclass.com/php.html) **do not use your test or production there!**

```PHP
$youHash = ""; // past you hash here
$testKey = "d9d359cce9371de02914c42d2786c0d9";
$testIV = "bb78c8065a90e05f1520b8ca17de1295";
$key = pack('H*', substr($testKey, 0, 32));
$iv = hex2bin(substr($testIV, 0, 32));
$decrypted = openssl_decrypt(
    $youHash,
    'AES-128-CBC',
    $key,
    OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING,
    $iv
);
var_dump($decrypted);
```

#### Authorization
In the `Authorization` header use the `consumer_key` as login and `api_key` as password `base64` encoded

```bash
Authorization: Basic base64_encode(consumer_key:api_key)
```

#### Content-Type
only `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` will be accepted
```bash
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

#### X-LightPAY-Credentials
you must concatenate the `api_key` and `secret_key` with the `+`, then you should sign the result with `AES-128-CBC`
> please see the [Signing](#Signing) chapter

```bash
// here SIGN is a dummy function, use your own fuction or see the Signing chapter
X-LightPAY-Credentials: SIGN($this->api_key . "+" . $this->secret_key)
```

### Signing
> only `AES-128-CBC` algorithm should be used with `PKCS7` as padding mode (in PHP set to 0 because this is the default mode)

[see other language example](#Other signing example)

You should use the example below in `PHP` or something similar in other languages.

- `key` should be the first 32 characters of the `secret_key`
- `iv` should be the first 32 characters of the `consumer_key`


```php
public function sign($data): ?string
{
    if (!$data)
        return "";

    try {
        $toSign = null;

        if (gettype($data) === "array")
            $toSign = '$1$' . implode("+", $data);
        else
            $toSign = '$1$' . $data;

        $key = pack('H*', substr("__SECRET_KEY__", 0, 32));
        $iv = hex2bin(substr("__CONSUMER_KEY__", 0, 32));
        $encrypted = openssl_encrypt(
            $toSign,
            "AES-128-CBC",
            $key,
            0,
            $iv
        );

        return (string)$encrypted;
    } catch (Exception $err) {
        error_log("[ERROR] : encryption error");
        error_log($err);
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Back office
Once you have your access to the back office, go to the WEB API page, you will find your credentials there.

#### IMPORTANT
In order to get the payment response you should set the `success_url` in the dedicated field.
